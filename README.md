<h3>Introduciton</h3>
<p>In modern computer systems, processors can perform operations on registers at an incredibly fast pace. However, accessing large capacity main memory, such as Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM), takes significantly more time in comparison. To address this performance gap, a small, high-speed memory called a cache is introduced between the processor and the main memory. The cache serves as a type of memory, storing frequently accessed data and instructions, thus reducing the time spent waiting for main memory access. This project aims to explore the functionality of n-way set associative caches, understand their working principles, and analyze the impact of various cache parameters on system performance.
